How To Start Game
------------------
Launch the 'Type for Me!' executable (File ending in .exe, .x86_64).
By default, the game starts in fullscreen. To change this, visit 'Options'. You'll also find volume options there, among other settings.

To uninstall this game, delete the entire 'Type for Me!' folder.

------------------
OS Specific Instructions
------------------
Windows - Smartscreen may block the game from opening. Click 'More info' and 'Run anyway'.

Linux - The game may not run as an executable.
• For Ubuntu, go to the executable's 'Properties, Permissions' and check the box for 'Allow executing file as program'.
• For other distros, you could run "chmod +x" on the executable to mark it as an executable.
• If the game crashes immediately, check "~/.config/unity3d/FireOtters/Type For Me!" for an error log

Changelog
------------------
v1.1 - Post-Jam Update (24 September 2023)
• 5 levels added, for a total of 9 levels. Each character has 3 levels, and each character's final level sports a slight speed boost
• Failure is more forgiving:
	• After a wrong key-press, further mistakes won't penalise the player until Backspace is pressed
	• When a word is completed the player may restart from that point if they fail the level
• Controlling the game is easier:
	• By default, players only need to click on the keyboard one time to commence dragging the object around
	• The character's hand will stop poking for a moment when a word is completed
• Presentation is improved:
	• A 'caret' to show where the next letter will be typed
	• The Backspace key pulsates when a mistake has been made
	• 'Typing Box' is now on top of the screen by default
	• Better level transitions, and consistent 'Typing Box' designs (now includes a current combo counter)
• More settings added:
	• Audio: Spatial music can be toggled. Frequency of character voice lines can be changed
	• Game: 'Typing Box' UI can be flipped. 'Hold To Drag' reverts the game to v1.0's control scheme. 'Mouse Sensitivity' helps players to adjust the new control scheme
• Bug fixes from v1.0:
	• Keyboard can no longer slide entirely off-screen
	• Audio now plays on iOS devices & Safari
	• Non-16x9 resolutions are letterboxed/pillarboxed
• We spent much time on ensuring these features are implemented well and ironing out bugs we found through playtesting. If you have a bug to report, we'd appreciate hearing about it on our itch.io page. Thanks for playing!


v1.0 - GMTK Game Jam Submission (9 July 2023)
• Game released!

------------------
Troubleshooting
------------------
• If the game doesn't allow you to drag the keyboard around, enable 'Hold to Drag' in the settings to try v1.0's old control scheme
	<!> Note for Linux: The 'Hold To Drag' control setting may not work correctly in Windowed mode, the cursor stops working when it exits the game window
